Titanic Survival Prediction project! This classic machine learning problem is based on real passenger data from the Titanic’s tragic voyage in 1912. The goal is to build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger would have survived based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and more.

This project was designed to explore the complete data science pipeline — from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. It’s a great way to practice working with real-world, imperfect data and applying supervised learning techniques.

📊 Bivariate Analysis (Feature vs Target)
See how features relate to survival:

Survival by gender: sns.barplot(x='Sex', y='Survived')

Survival by passenger class: sns.barplot(x='Pclass', y='Survived')

Survival by age group: create age bins and use a barplot

Survival by fare ranges: same idea with fare bins

📉 Multivariate Analysis
Survival by Pclass and Sex: sns.catplot(x='Pclass', hue='Sex', col='Survived', kind='count')

Heatmap of feature correlations: sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')

📦 Handling Missing Data Visualization
Visualize missing values with sns.heatmap(df.isnull(), cbar=False, cmap='viridis')

Or use missingno library (pip install missingno) → msno.matrix(df)

🚢 Interesting Ideas:
Family size feature: combine SibSp and Parch and visualize against survival

Title extraction from names (Mr, Mrs, Miss, etc.) and see survival rates

If you’d like, I can help you write the code snippets for each of these or package them into a Jupyter notebook layout. Want me to do that? ⚙️✨s
