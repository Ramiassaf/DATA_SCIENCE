# Studio_Image_Classification
The project focuses on a diverse image dataset sourced from a well-known photo studio, encompassing captivating image records contributed by various photographers. These images are captured at the same location, presenting an intriguing challenge for comprehensive data analysis and categorization.

Project Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to delve into the realm of image processing and machine learning to create an efficient model that can autonomously classify the diverse photographs within the dataset. Given the vastness of the dataset and the absence of pre-existing labels, the task of categorizing these images manually is an arduous endeavor. Therefore, as aspiring data scientists, the project aims to develop a robust machine learning solution capable of assigning appropriate labels to the images.
